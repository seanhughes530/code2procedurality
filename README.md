I am from New York and I am BAFA student at The New School studying Design and Technology at Parsons and Interdisciplinary Science at Eugene Lang.
I studied photography at SUNY New Paltz for two and a half years before trasnferring here and I currently work for a few startups 
doing graphic design and administrative assistant work. I am looking forward to better understanding things like recursive relationships
in code as well as looking at more forms of generative art.
